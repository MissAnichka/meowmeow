                <p>Surround yourself with the things that truly matter to you. You know you are in your element when your mind, heart, and gut are aligned. This includes surrounding yourself with thoughts, words and actions of love and compassion for yourself and others. This includes creating and cultivating the environment for you to flourish in. Take a moment to meditate on the beauty that surrounds you, whatever that is, wherever you are, however you see it. Find the beauty in your daily surroundings that you may have tuned out. Take this moment to appreciate something that has gone unnoticed. Cherish the beauty of this moment, of taking the time to be present and in awe of the world around you. Close your eyes and conjour a feeling of being surrounded with love. Remember what it felt like when you experienced it and immerse yourself in that feeling once more. Choose activities that speak to you. Do the things that fulfill you. Learn things that interest you. Spend time and energy on that which replenishes you. You deserve good things, surround yourself with them. </p>

                <div class="peace">
                <p>Stand up for your self. Stand up for the things you believe in. Stand up for what's right. Too often we believe if we just keep doing the right thing, others will notice, or the universe will respond, even if we stay silent in moments that matter. That is not always the case. If you have an opportunity to stick up for yourself or for someone else, grab it. Own it. This isn't a call to engage in reckless behavior. This is a call to end it. Other people, and the universe, don't know who you are, can't read your mind. Speak it. Communicate your wants, needs, desires. Get in touch with yourself and emanate who you are to the universe. Speak your mind before someone else makes decisions for you that don't truly reflect You. </p>

                <p>Stand up for your self by setting high standards for your self, your life, and the things you allow in it. Once you clear away the things that no longer serve you and discover your standards, you will find yourself only allowing the things you love into your life. </p>

                <p>How to set your standards:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn about <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-are-personal-boundaries-how-do-i-get-some/" target="_blank">boundaries</a></li><br>
                        <li>Turn your negative self-talk into positive talk with <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=6622458&page=1" target="_blank">extreme self care</a> </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Why this works - learning about <a href="http://www.boundariesbooks.com/" target="_blank">boundaries</a> helps you create and defend your own boundaries. Once you are certain what your boundaries are, nobody can take that away from you. Knowing your boundaries allows you to easily and quickly identify when you are at a point where you need to stop and take care of yourself, before you get to a point where things have gotten out of hand. Also, your negative self-talk allows others to communicate with you in that same negative manner without you even noticing - because you are used to it from yourself. Once you <a href="https://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/7-steps-to-positive-self-talk/" target="_blank">change your thoughts</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=positive+affirmations" target="_blank">kind and compassionate self-talk</a>, you will quicky notice when others do not speak to you kindly, as you speak to yourself. These two adjustments, in turn, allow you to identify those moments where you need to stand up for yourself, and give you the confidence to do so. </p>
